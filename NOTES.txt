TASK - 6 :Store user details and send email for each registration , login API also done .
DATABASE NAME : mailer
Table Name : users

This Task is a Node.js app with MySQL for managing user registration and login. 
User details are stored in a users table, including fields like username, email, and hashed passwords (using bcrypt).
Registration triggers a confirmation email via Nodemailer using Gmail SMTP. 
The app includes two endpoints: one for registration (saves user data and sends an email) and 
another for login (validates email and password). 
It uses environment variables for sensitive credentials.
MySQL handles data storage, while the app ensures secure authentication and email functionality.
The project is modular, with separate controllers, routes, and utilities.
